There is no authentication applied and no Auth system applied.</br></br>
I have just created API's sample for user's Loan module.</br>
There is no schema for loan return handling because due to time shortage I am just able to do these apis and We can also handle active loan and pending loans in just one api by passing parameter active and pending. but these type of things creates a mess in a big project and also creates the mess when we go for the filters and other stuff.

Steps:</br>
Install node mobules by run following command</br>
<b>npm i</b>
start project:</br>
<b>npm run start</b></br></br>
You can see the swagger documentation by hit following url</br>
http://localhost:3000/api-docs/ </br></br>
then you need to run seeding api for enter dummy entries in it. I can also create the seeder for this, but I prefer to create the api for seeder due to time shortage.
